* Design Choices
** Regular Expressions
- Use the simplest backend as possible:
  Pandas takes 0.3s to import, while regex imports under 0.01s. 
  Also, parsing with regex takes ~0.03s, while it takes 0.1s in pandas.
  0.3s seems to be acceptable, but 0.3s x 10k pdbs takes 50 minutes just
  to import pandas!
